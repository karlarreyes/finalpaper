## Predicting Treatment for Heart Attack Risk Using Data Management
This project aims analyze common heart attack risk factors and creating a prediction model for treatment. 

## Dataset
The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/heart-attack-dataset/data![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ceacc30-de92-458a-a327-ff5c208848b0)
Then save the dataset as a csv file to use 

## Create the virtual environment 
```python -m venv venv```

## Activate virtual environment
On Windows:

```venv\Scripts\activate```

On MacOS:

```source venv/bin/activate```

## Installing Required Libraries

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Running the Course Project
open ```my_project.ipynb``` Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to train and evaluate the model.
